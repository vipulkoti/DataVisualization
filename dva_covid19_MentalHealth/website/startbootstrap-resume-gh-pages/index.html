                      <p>
                          Roughly three weeks into January, 2020 the first reported cases of COVID-19 were documented in United States. COVID-19 has since cascaded across the US and the rest of the world, with the WHO announcing a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Shortly after, government officials across the country to initiate mandated stay-at-homeorders, which effectively limited population movement across much of the US. In this initial stage of the pandemic, <b>remote workers were three times less likely to lose their job</b> compared to those without the ability to work remotely. <br /><br />Additionally, COVID-19 has been found to increase labor
                          market inequality and multiple industries have seen unique and different labor impacts in terms of remote work due to COVID-19. This inequality has brought a significant risk to workers, as even though <b>97% of employees recommend to others the benefits of remote work and wish to continue to work remotely</b>, COVID-19 related job displacement has typically been unrelated to work performance, but has been related to the ability to work remotely. These challenges make it more critical than ever to understand what employment data is telling us, so resources can be made available to meet the changing scope of work post-COVID.
